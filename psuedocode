//MAJOR TASK
//1. defining the current hour,properly displaying hours throughout the day
//dayjs for current hour and date
//var currentHour dayjs
//easier way of ID
//each
var currentHour //compare the current hour of individ blovks
var blockHour
//each element that has a class con jquery-each
///nest these functions
$('.time-block').each(function(){
    if(blockHour < currentHour) {
$()
    }
} else if (blockHour===currentHour){
    $(currentHour)

}else {
});
///focus on this bc it will save you a massive amount of time


//conditionlly apply ppf classes con
//if statements of ppf nested in to a timer
//2. allow the user to save notes within individiual timeblocks,have the data save to local storage and utilize local storage each time the page loads to have persistent data
buttonid.eventListener
//.clickon
//jquery .on method
//before you nest the messages but .onmethod

//3.Display the current date on the header of the page

// TODO: Add a listener for click events on the save button. This code should
  // use the id in the containing time-block as a key to save the user input in
  // local storage. HINT: What does `this` reference in the click listener
  // function? How can DOM traversal be used to get the "hour-x" id of the
  // time-block containing the button that was clicked? How might the id be
  // useful when saving the description in local storage?

  // block by comparing the id to the current hour. HINTS: How can the id
  // attribute of each time-block be used to conditionally add or remove the
  // past, present, and future classes? How can Day.js be used to get the
  // current hour in 24-hour time?
  //
  // TODO: Add code to get any user input that was saved in localStorage and set
  // the values of the corresponding textarea elements. HINT: How can the id
  // attribute of each time-block be used to do this?
